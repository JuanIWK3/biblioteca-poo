## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
- `menu`: to list the options to the user
- `model`: to create the objects and its methods
- `dao`: to access and modify the data
- `tools`: to use external functions such as connection to the database
